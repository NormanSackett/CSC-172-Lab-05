In lab 5, we were tasked with implementing a hash table. We had to include basic methods for inserting values, key lookup, and fetching basic information about the hash table (such as if it's empty). We also had to ensure that the hash table automatically resizes and rehashes its keys and values if a value is inserted while the table is full. The UR_HashTable class just contains the abstract methods that we had to implement. URHashTable actually contains the method implementations and a custom iterator for traversing the hash table. UnitTest contains the program's unit tests, ensuring that all methods work properly.
